## Problems I ran into
---
##### I tried to used the github repo within atom and not quite sure where all that work ended up. I ended up 
creating a new repo and making copy of files to new folder to github.

(https://loading.io/transition/) Transition.css was one of the websites I used for sliding images on index.html site

(http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) Hover.css was site I used for buzz animation for naviagion buttons.

+ I am having problems with images sitting to left side of page. I think I am over-styling and can't figure out how 
 --- how to scoot over.
+ I tried to resolve issue by sitting images inside article twice - making 2nd embedded article transparent just to center.
+ Also can't can't get any styling to work with flexbox - center | space between | space around . etc.
