						<h2>Work in the Community</h2>

									<br>

									<p>The Coyote loves the city that has given him the opportunity to share the game that he loves with so many people. He thinks about his mom and how she helped him fall in love with the game of basketball and taught him to have fun, but to also help others whenever you can - and The Coyote does just that. Every year, The Coyote helps local non-profits, visits sick children in hospitals, gets kids cool new shoes for school and even helps them learn some awesome moves like his mom taught him.</p>

									<br>

									<p>The Coyote participates in many community events throughout the year to help promote healthier lifestyles for kids. He teams up with local non-profits, a popular grocery store, local food banks, and area schools to promote healthy choices for kids wherever they are and to ensure that kids around the city are not hungry.
									The Coyote also supports many local hospitals. He has visited 92-year old fans before surgery, children on Halloween, and helped officials celebrate the opening of a new helipad that would help a local children’s hospital serve more children from surrounding areas.</p>

									<br>

									<p>Remembering that he came from humble beginnings, The Coyote also helps some children in underserved neighborhoods with school supplies and new shoes.</p>

									<br>

									<p>And finally, each year The Coyote shares his love for the game of basketball through the many Summer Camps that the Spurs’ players put together. There, kids get to learn the fundamentals of the game and importance of teamwork.</p>
