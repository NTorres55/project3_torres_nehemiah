					<h2>Early Life</h2>

					<br>

						<p>The Coyote was born on April 13, 1983 in a small cave in South Texas. He was an only pup but grew up in a very loving and supportive. He didn’t have many other coyotes to play with, so he had to find a game to play with his family. Fortunately for the young Coyote, Mama Coyote loved basketball. She was really good at basketball and taught the young pup everything she knew about basketball. He practiced and played every day and dreamed of one day becoming a professional basketball player.</p>

						<br><br>

						<p>When he was old enough to leave home, he went to try out for his favorite team – the San Antonio Spurs. Although he was talented enough, he was told that unfortunately, coyotes were not allowed to play, even if they were vaccinated. The Coyote was devastated. This was his dream and he was not about to give up on it. He went back to ask for another chance. Seeing his dedication and natural talent, the Spurs found a spot on the team for The Coyote.</p>

						<h2>Career</h2>

							<br>

							<p>Today, The Coyote shares the love of the game with his son Buddy. He has taken him to games to watch since he got his first rabies shots and hasn’t missed a game. Now that Buddy is a bit older, he shares the spotlight with The Coyote and helps him entertain the crowd and keep the team motivated whenever necessary. The Coyote does great work off the court as well and has become one of the most recognizable mascots in professional sports.</p>
